## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, Redux, JavaScript, CSS, Node, Express, MongoDB, Json Web Token

I started by constructing the backend, as I had more experience with that and knew React/Redux would be a challenge to figure out. The frontend took a lot more work and was very difficult until I discovered services and slices, which are used for the JWT authentication service to guarantee that only authorized users have access to their goals.

## Lessons Learned:

My major accomplishment with this project was learning how to correctly use redux and all of its capabilities.

## Examples:

Take a look at the example that I have in my own portfolio:
